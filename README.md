# C Piscine Shell 00 Project Summary

## Skills Acquired
1. **File Creation & Manipulation**: Learned to create files with specific content and attributes (`Exercise 00`, `Exercise 01`).
  
2. **Shell Scripting**: Built simple shell scripts to interact with Git and find specific files (`Exercise 05`, `Exercise 06`).

3. **SSH Key Management**: Understood the creation and utilization of SSH keys (`Exercise 03`).

4. **File System Commands**: Mastered basic commands like `ls` and `find` for file system operations (`Exercise 04`, `Exercise 08`).

5. **File Types**: Learned to create a magic file for detecting custom file types (`Exercise 09`).
